Note 1: Your package manager may have a precompiled copy
already. There are versions in Debian, Ubuntu, Macports and others. In
that case you need to download from here only if you want a different
version or want to hack on the source.

Note 2: the names changed in version 5.0: most programs got an "hx"
prefix. Please, uninstall any version < 5.0 before installing a
version >= 5.0

This package is configured with automake/autoconf. Generic
instructions are in the file INSTALL. Here are some specific problems
that may arise:

1) Error when running lex:

      lex   scan.l && mv lex.yy.c scan.c
      "scan.l":line 2: Error: missing translation value

   The scan.l file uses features of flex that do not exist in lex.
   However, it is not necessary to run lex, since the file scan.c is
   provided in the package. Just do a "touch scan.c" to make sure
   "make" will not try to generate it anew.

2) Warning about "libidn not found":

  Without libidn2 or libidn, hxwls will not be able to translate
  Internationalized Domain Names to ASCII (option -a). You can install
  either libidn2 or libidn.

  If you install them in a non-standard location, use --with-libidn2
  or --with-libidn when invoking ./configure. E.g., if you install
  libidn from MacPorts on Mac OS X, run:

      ./configure --with-libidn=/opt/local
